Testing to see if the pipeline works

2

Comparing sparse with MPO for N = 4

3 

Trying out two different time steps one after the other

4

Producing plot for time per iteration vs 1/N

5

At N = 10 for fixed parameters change the cutoff to see how the maximum and average bond dimensions behave

15 

This is to comparing to pulse field project 14 in branch time_varying_l0

16 

I have to go a bit smaller than N = 20 which is project 15. I will go down to N = 12 first and have a project in the time_varying_l0
as well to be able to compare. What we want to compare is open vs closed and time varying vs static applied field. Further I should
always have a couple of cutoffs to be sure of convergence.
