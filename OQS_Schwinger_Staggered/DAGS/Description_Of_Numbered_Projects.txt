1

Testing to see if the pipeline works

2

Comparing sparse with MPO for N = 4

3 

Trying out two different time steps one after the other

4

Producing plot for time per iteration vs 1/N

5

At N = 10 for fixed parameters change the cutoff to see how the maximum and average bond dimensions behave

15 

This is to comparing to pulse field project 14 in branch time_varying_l0

16 

I have to go a bit smaller than N = 20 which is project 15. I will go down to N = 12 first and have a project in the time_varying_l0
as well to be able to compare. What we want to compare is open vs closed and time varying vs static applied field. Further I should
always have a couple of cutoffs to be sure of convergence.

20 

Same as 19 pulse project to compare

21 

New version of pipeline where pulse and static are submitted in the same branch by the same file but 1 dag for each one

22

Now that the new pipeline can generate states without error we can proceed with exploring for N = 12 different values of omega, Omega and l0s
and compare them with the static field for different l_0 values.

23 

Changed pipeline into the pulse including three types sauter, gaussian, oscillating and this is a test with small values for the pipeline
