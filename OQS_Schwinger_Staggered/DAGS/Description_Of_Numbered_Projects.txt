Testing to see if the pipeline works

2

Comparing sparse with MPO for N = 4

3 

Trying out two different time steps one after the other

4

Producing plot for time per iteration vs 1/N

5

At N = 10 for fixed parameters change the cutoff to see how the maximum and average bond dimensions behave
quenching from the dirac vacuum

6 

Now that I corrected the functions eg of the initial state I will reproduce project 5 results maybe with slightly different
m and g coming from Guiseppe's paper and I have also noticed that a small time step keeps the bond dimension very small I guess
until I evolve long enough. Note here we are quenching the electric field keeping the lattice mass constant. In the future we want
to quench also the mass and also keep track of the mass shift.

Was for N = 50 and very small cutoff but the jobs were running out of memory because the state was written at every iteration so all jobs
were forced to stop

8

N = 8 with sparse as well to compare for different cutoffs and l_0 values.
The problem here which caused the jobs to diverge was that too high l_0 values cause the L_taylor*tau (tau = 0.01) to be
very large so the approximation was not good and the stability was lost

9 

Simple example with a reasonable l_0 value of [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]  at N = 8 to follow up from project 8

10

This is to focus on only changing N and measuring the maximum entropy reached hopefully of the steady state so as to probe the scaling
of the entanglement entropy of the steady state vs N

11

Checking the closed case although we can do the closed case with MPS anyhow so we don't have to care much about it
but we will give it different tau but same total time

12 

This is about reproducing results from slides 72, 73 quenching the GS of H within closed and open systems 
for N = 8, 10, 12, e = 1, l_0 = -1, ma = -0.1, aD_0 = 0, 0.5, beta = 0.1, corr = delta, tau needs to be set carefully
we will go up to at = 6 and we need a tau of 0.01 such that Ltaylor*dt/2 is much less than 1 so we need 600 steps

Test the pulse field

N = 20 pulse field different cutoff
